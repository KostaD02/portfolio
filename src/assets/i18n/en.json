The QR code can be placed on any object, and the data that is displayed will vary depending on the user's status. For example, in a university setting, employees and students could be given different access to information about classes, events, and resources.",
      "text_3": "The QR code assigned to a room remains unchanged even if the processes in the room change. This means that the QR code only needs to be updated once, even if the information about the room changes frequently. For example, if a classroom is used for different classes throughout the day, the QR code would not need to be updated each time.",
      "text_4": "The software product can be used to digitize cities, providing different information to users of different access levels.

Customers could use QR codes to access information about loyalty programs and special offers.",
