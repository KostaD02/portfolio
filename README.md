This repository was originally built using Angular. While Angular is a powerful framework, it proved to be overkill for the scope of this project, akin to hunting deer with an atomic bomb. To streamline the project and enhance performance, I am in the process of rebuilding it using Eleventy, a simpler and more efficient static site generator.
